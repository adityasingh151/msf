                The Mathematical Sciences Foundation (MSF) has a rich history that traces back to the consolidation of various mathematical activities into the Centre for Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at St. Stephen's College in 1998. In 2000, substantial funding from ICICI Bank transformed CMS into the ICICI Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS). This center rapidly expanded, offering innovative programs that outgrew its initial capacity, leading to the establishment of the Mathematical Sciences Foundation in July 2002. Dr. Anil Wilson, Principal of St. Stephen's College and former Vice-Chancellor of Himachal Pradesh University, served as the Founder Chairman.

                MSF's mission is to promote mathematics at all educational levels, from school to research. It operates from Delhi, India, and offers undergraduate programs in Mathematical Finance and Mathematical Simulation with IT, and graduate programs in partnership with the University of Houston leading to PhDs in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics. The foundation also hosts significant seminars and conferences, such as the "Life of Mathematics" and "Mathematics in the 20th Century," attracting prominent mathematicians worldwide.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed font-serif text-justify">
                The foundation's initiatives extend to contests like the MSF Challenge and Recognizing Ramanujan, aimed at encouraging school students to engage with mathematics innovatively and recognize their problem-solving skills. These contests not only promote mathematical thinking but also honor the legacy of great Indian mathematicians such as Srinivasa Ramanujan.

                The roots of MSF go back to the mid-1990s with educational and research activities undertaken by a group of mathematicians from several institutions, such as University of Delhi, St. Stephen’s College, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and the Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi. They were subsequently joined by members of the Economics and Physics faculties from St. Stephen’s College.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed font-serif text-justify">
                The early projects were mostly carried out with funding from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India. Notable amongst these was the project titled Mathematics in the Modern World (MMW), which ran from 1995 to 2001, and aimed at showing the applicability of mathematics in solving real-life problems.

One of the key programs is the "Life of Mathematics," which annually brings distinguished mathematicians to St. Stephen's College for direct interaction with students and faculty. Recent participants have included notable figures like Sir Michael Atiyah and Martin Golubitsky. The "Mathematics in the 20th Century" conference, held in 2006, was another significant event that highlighted the contributions of mathematicians over the past century and facilitated discussions on future directions in the field.

                MSF offers scholarships and fellowships to deserving students based on merit and financial need. These scholarships are intended to cover tuition fees and, in some cases, provide a stipend for living expenses. For instance, graduate students participating in the programs in collaboration with the University of Houston receive training at MSF for a year, during which they are likely supported through scholarships or stipends to cover their educational expenses​.
