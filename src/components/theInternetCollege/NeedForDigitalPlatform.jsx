          The Need for an ‘Out of the Box’ Digital and Technology Based Learning Platform

          From all that has been said above, it has become increasingly clear that in most parts of the world, the traditional systems of knowledge and learning are not delivering what is needed by large segments of society. The most apparent and worrying aspects of these traditional streams of learning are the following:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-serif text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Misalignment with student needs:</strong> Today’s universities are not tuned in to providing gainful knowledge and skills relevant to the current job market.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Outdated teaching methods:</strong> Traditional universities are either overpriced, offer poor learning environments, or rely on outdated curricula. For instance, an undergraduate student from Indiana University Bloomington mentioned that YouTube served as a better teacher than their professor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mismatch with societal needs:</strong> There is an enormous gap between what traditional universities teach and what society actually requires in the modern age.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The issue in India:</strong> The country faces an increasing population, with millions needing education that is both relevant and accessible. However, existing institutions are inadequate in terms of both quality and capacity, unable to accommodate the growing number of high school graduates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technology as a solution:</strong> A well-designed, technology-based platform tuned to the needs of the young can be revolutionary. This idea is supported by the success of two financially thriving institutions in India despite their poor quality:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li>
                <strong>School of Open Learning, University of Delhi:</strong> This institution offers outdated courses with little use of technology and poor job prospects, yet it has more than half a million students and overflowing coffers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU):</strong> IGNOU has more students than all Central Universities in India combined, despite offering low-quality programs with minimal technology use.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-serif text-gray-700">
          The Internet College is designed to address these concerns by providing engaging and hands-on education that tackles the needs and challenges of society. The youth shall be exposed to real-world issues and inspired to tackle them on a sustained, long-term basis.
